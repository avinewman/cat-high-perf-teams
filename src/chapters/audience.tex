\chapter{Audience}

Who is this book for? Well, in a nutshell: me, right as I was entering the workforce. 
A new graduate trying to find his way in a professional world, stumbling just trying to help. He's wondering 
why most people don't get on board with his ideas, and what to do about it. This book is the one I wish 
I was handed when I joined my first professional team.

If you are a professional in the workforce and are curious about how you can have a bigger impact
in your workplace regardless of what your job title is, this is for you. Whether you are an analyst
on your first internship or a seasoned software engineer, there is wisdom in these pages that you
can use.

Much of what you will find here is taken from a professional point of view. However, since I tend to
integrate things more often than not, you'll find that you can apply these techniques throughout your
whole life.

So whether you are starry-eyed or jaded, white-collar or independent, there's something in here
for you. May it be of great benefit.
