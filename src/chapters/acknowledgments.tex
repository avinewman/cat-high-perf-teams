\chapter{Acknowledgments}
The following provided tons of useful feedback throughout my work on this book (in no particular order):
Jeffrey Davidson, Jonathan Locker, and Brett Lischalk. If you find this book comprehensible in any way,
it is because they gave me pointers on how to reach people that didn't have my unique view of the world.
