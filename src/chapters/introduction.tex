\chapter{Introduction}

My path has been a fairly twisty one. From high school, I was always interested in computers, as well as
spirituality. I didn't know it at the time, but those two thought systems would remain fairly separate in my mind
for over a decade, only to merge into a single whole. In hindsight, though, it might have been easy to see. As I 
was graduating from college and bidding goodbye to my therapist, he said something that will stick with me 
forever. ``I believe you will find a way to merge technology and spirituality in a way nobody ever predicted.'' 
Perhaps this is the beginning of that endeavor!

The question of how to make a high-performing team has been on our collective minds since the dawn of time.
As we have evolved, becoming capable of seeing greater and greater levels of complexity, we invented
more, subtler methods for establishing, controlling, cajoling, incentivizing, and so on, all in the name of progress.

My first experience with this approach was my first job out of college. I had absolutely no idea what ``good''
was for a software team, but from the beginning I was dissatisfied. It seemed like people were wasting time on 
things that could have been more effectively done if we could only figure out how to automate more manual
repetitive tasks, and do them more often. That way, we would always stay ``close to the ground'' as we were
doing our work.
