\chapter{Introduction}

My own path has been a fairly twisted one. From high school, I was always interested in computers, as well as
spirituality. I didn't know it at the time, but those two thought systems would remain fairly separate in my mind
for over a decade. In hindsight, though, it might have been easy to see. As I was graduating from college
and bidding goodbye to my therapist, he said something that will stick with me forever. ``I believe you will find
a way to merge technology and spirituality in a way nobody ever predicted.'' Perhaps this is the beginning
of that endeavor!

The question of how to make a high-performing team has been on our collective minds since the dawn of time.
As we have evolved, becoming ever more ready to see greater and greater levels of complexity, we invented
more methods for establishing, controlling, cajoling, incentivizing, and so on, all in the name of progress.

My own experience with this method was my first job out of high school. I had absolutely no idea what ``good''
was for a software team, but from the beginning I was dissatisfied. It seemed like people were wasting time on 
things that could have been more effectively done if we could only figure out how to automate more manual
repetitive tasks, and do them more often. That way, we would always stay ``close to the ground'' as we were
doing our work.
