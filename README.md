feedforward
===========

Peer-based Feedforward Protocol.

Exerpt from the article:

> In this document, we will discuss a protocol designed to
> help people come to their own insights, while also receiving
> helpful information from their own team. This has the effect
> of not only amplifying each personâ€™s own learning, but
> creating a bonding experience with teammates that is
> meaningful and connected to their actual work experience.

Cleaning up
-----------
The build script generates a lot of stuff. If you'd like to get back to
a pristine environment, run:

        make clean

Publishing
----------
Publishing happens automatically using travis-ci, so doing it manually is not recommended.
However, if there is an urgent need, you can use this manual approach.
You'll need the [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) 
installed.

Also, you'll need credentials configured using the "couragelabs" profile. If you are confused about
what this is, drop us a line ([our website](http://www.couragelabs.com) should tell you how).

Run:

        make publish
